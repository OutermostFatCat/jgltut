OpenGL 3.3 tutorials with LWJGL
===============================

This project is a port of McKesson's OpenGL tutorials to Java using LWJGL and it is distributed in the hope that it will be useful.

[Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming](http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/index.html) is the book where to start; you can find the original c++ source code
[here](https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/gltut/wiki/Home).  


Tutorials ported so far: 16.2 of 17.3


If you don't want to download the source code you can play with the tutorials with [this simple program](https://github.com/downloads/rosickteam/OpenGL/tutorial-chooser.zip).


To suggest a feature, report a bug, or general discussion please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/rosickteam/OpenGL/issues).  
Happy coding!

General information
-------------------
The project is developed with Java 1.7 and LWJGL 2.8.3, and may not work with older versions.  
To download and install LWJGL visit the [official site](http://www.lwjgl.org/). 

- "rosick/jglsdk" 	: package with the glsdk port.
- "rosick/mckesson" : package with the tutorials port.

To test it out, it is recommended to use [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/).  
Open Eclipse, copy or link the "rosick" package into an existing project (in the "src" folder) and, if you haven't already done, 
add and configure the LWJGL library in the project build path. Open any tutorial and run it by clicking the 'play' button.
