Hi all!
We are right OpenGL beginners like a lot of you, and we know how frustrating is not find any good resources on modern OpenGL programming techniques, so
we are proud to start this project for porting the McKesson's tutorials to Java with LWJGL.
This is the book where to start: http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/index.html
We decided to put online our work, although it is far from complete, to give to all LWJGL users a nice starting point for the understanding of OpenGL 3.3.
We are dedicating to this project most of our free time and it will update frequently.
Best regards,

Francesco & Marco


GITHUB USERS :
I kindly ask github users not to pull requests at this time.
We want to develop this project with our hands and if possibly to translate every tutorial of the book.
If we are not be able to continue working on this project, then we will be happy to let each user contributes with their code.
On the other hand, we ask you to communicate us every issue or difficulty that you have found in this project.
Thanks in advance.


FOLDERS STRUCTURE :
	- "rosick/common" : package with common files used by all the tutorials.
	- "rosick/mckesson" : package with LWJGL porting of Jason McKesson OpenGL tutorials.
		
		
USAGE WITH ECLIPSE IDE :
To test the tutorials, copy or link the "rosick" package into an existing project (in the "src" folder).
If you haven't already done, in the project build path add and configure the lwjgl library (visit http://www.lwjgl.org/ for further information).
